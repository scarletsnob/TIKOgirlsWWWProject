		<h2>Beautiful manor house in the middle of the most beautiful Finnish nature</h2>
<p>Imaginary Museo´s main bulding in Somero was originally built in 1841 and opened to the public after the restoration in 2011.</p>
<p>Culture historically, in the valuable restoration of the main building has been respectful of the construction of its era, 
style and taste.</p>
<p>Beautiful old roof paintings were renovated under the supervision and assistance of the National Board of Antiquities.</p>
<p>We work from the beginning of May to the end of September. <br />We offer atmospheric banquet rooms, 400 m² rooms, 
gentlemen's rooms, ladies' chambers and bright decks to memorable family celebrations.</p>
<p>We are open to groups by agreement.

Upstairs in the yard of the stonebarn is a display of the memories of gold - the youth charm: </p>
<p>The life and mood of the 1950 - 1960s is also featured in the Hovila Street, which is open upstairs. </p>
<p>The audience has been thrilled to receive a new tourist destination. 
Our guest have been for example the impressive museum car´s balconies and the dancing milieu have been recalled with evergreens of reminiscences with new arrangements.</p>
<p>Exhibitions and events as well as publicity sections have pictures and information about exhibitions already carried out.</p>
<p>Our services include guided manor and nature tours, we also plan tours according to your wishes. </p>
<p>In the Guided Tours and Excursions section, we will show you the programmatic Manor to Somero.</p>
<p>Our café is open during the exhibitions. <br />For groups and celebrations, we order a local party table at Käräjäsali. <br /> </p>
